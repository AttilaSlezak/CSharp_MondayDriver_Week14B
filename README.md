<h2>A simple file manager application</h2>

In this task I had to create a simple file manager Windows Form application in C#.

The program contains:
<ol>
  <li>a ComboBox what displays the letter and the type of the current drive and the user can change between the different drives in the machine</li>
  <li>a TextBox what displays the current path on the chosen drive </li>
  <li>a ListBox what displays the directories and files on the current path</li>
  <li>an 'Open' Button what opens a selected directory or a file; files is opened in a chat window and its content can be read in a RichTextBox (if the content is a text)</li>
  <li>a 'Delete' button what removes the selected directories or files</li>
</ol>
